Setting up your development environment
=======================================

# Editor

You will need an editor where you will write and edit your code. I will use [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) during class. You may also use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) along with a [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). There are several others, but your TA and I will be able to help you the most with these two. I strongly recommend *against* using PyCharm unless you feel very comfortable mastering the learning curve on your own.

# Python

You will need to download the [python environment](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

If you are using Sublime Text as your editor, you will need to make sure python is set up to be accessed via a command line tool. On a Mac you can use the [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac). On a Windows computer you should install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 

# GitHub

1. Create a new user account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). 
2. [Install git on your computer](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). You may need to reload VSCode once you install git.
3. Sign in to GitHub via VSCode.

For each assignment you will create a GitHub repository. The general process for working on your assignments is as follows:

1. **Clone** the repository. This creates a local copy of the repository from GitHub.
2. Repeat:
   - Edit your code
   - *Stage Changes*. This will *add* all files you have edited.
   - Enter a meaningful commit message.
   - *Commit & Push* your changes.
   - Visit the repository on GitHub to confirm that your changes were uploaded successfully

# Unix

Even if you are using VSCode, you will need to be familiar with some basic unix commands that you will use at the command line. You may wish to go through an online Unix tutorial. Google and Chat GPT will both provide lots of resources in response to the query "Unix tutorial". The commands you will use most are the following:

- `cd` - change into a new directory
- `ls` - list the contents of the existing directory
- `python` (or `python3`) - run a python program
- `rm` - remove a file

The following screencast demonstrates how to create your assignment repository, clone your assignment using VSCode, edit your code, and commit and push your changes to GitHub.
